# Super Over 2D Cricket

## Overview
Welcome to Super Over 2D Cricket, an immersive and thrilling cricket experience designed for cricket enthusiasts and casual gamers alike. Face the high-pressure scenario of a Super Over that means only six balls over, where every ball counts and every run matters. With intuitive controls, realistic physics, and dynamic gameplay, Super Over 2D Cricket brings the excitement of cricket right to your fingertips.

## Gameplay
- Objective: Score as many runs as possible within the allotted six deliveries to meet or exceed the target score set for the over. The target score is randomly set for each match, ensuring a fresh challenge every time you play.
- Controls: Use simple touch gestures to flick the ball and score runs. The line renderer helps guide your flick direction, allowing for precise and strategic shots.
- Batting: Face various deliveries from the bowler, each with its own unique challenge. Time your flicks perfectly to hit the ball with power and accuracy.
- Scoring: Hit the ball into designated scoring zones to earn runs. Zones include "One", "Two", "Four", and "Six", each granting different run values. Aim for the boundaries to maximize your score.
- Fielding: Watch out for fielders strategically placed on the field. If the ball rests on a fielder's platform for too long, you'll be caught out, and the game will end.
- Stumps: Be careful not to hit the stumps, as this will immediately end your innings. If the ball hits the stumps, the stump sprite will change, and a game over message will appear after a short delay.
